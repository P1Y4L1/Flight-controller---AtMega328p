PCB designs of a flight controller with the help of AtMega328p

Flight controls nowadays are costly and are too complex to operate for a beginner with drones. 
This makes operating the drone difficult and also we  consider the fact that we need to buy the expensive flight controller from the market. 
The significance of this paper is to show that we can make a basic flight controller back at home making it cheap and also quite basic to operate.
The 3 softwares used to make the PCB design of the Flight controller is Eagle Cad which is quite famous in the market however it is highly charged ;  
KiCad , a free and an open source software which is easily accessible and is beginner friendly ; last but not the least Fritzing , which is not commonly used by 
everyone , but is also open source but makes electronics accessible as a creative material for anyone.  With the help of these 3 softwares , it is shown that the 
PCB design of the Flight controller can be made in any software required and not necessarily in any of those 3 mentioned above.
